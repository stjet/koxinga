Koxinga is a web browser supporting text and links.

## Usage

- `u`: URL mode, where a URL can be inputted. Hit enter/return to go to that page.
- `l`: Link mode. The page will now show numbers in front of any links. Input the number corresponding to the link to navigate to, then hit enter/return.
- `s`: Search mode. Search engine is http://frogfind.de. Frogfind doesn't seem to use a valid HTTPS certificate yet. But all the other search engines block Koxinga, do not work without Javascript, or give horribly mangled invalid HTML. Such is the state of the world...
- `j`, `k` to scroll page.
- `0`: Go to top of page.
- `G`: Go to bottom of page.
